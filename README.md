## Abstract
Given a picture containing a braille message, the application translates the message into text and outputs two items:
- the corresponding message in ascii; and
- the original image with the ascii characters above the braille symbols.

## Image processing techniques involved
The main image processing tasks that are going to be used are image segmentation and image enhancement to improve visualization quality allowing to recognize change of depth, texture patterns, etc.

## Aplication
The translator's main purpose is to contribute as an accessibility tool. With this application, one could easily translate braille to text and then be able to translate it to audio, for example. Also, it would work as a teaching device, helping children to learn braille in an easier way.
