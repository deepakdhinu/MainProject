## Abstract
Given a picture containing a braille message, translate that message to text, outputing the corresponding message and also the original image with the alphabet characters above the braille symbols.

The main image processing tasks that are going to be used are image segmentation and image enhancement, to recognize the change of depth.

## Aplication
The translator's main purpose is to contribute as an accessibility tool. With this application, one could easily translate braille to text and then be able to translate it to audio. It would also work as a teaching device,  helping children to learn braille.
